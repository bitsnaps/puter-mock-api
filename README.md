# 🖥️ Puter-Mock-API

> Because sometimes your cloud just needs to _pretend_.

A lightweight, zero-dependency API server that impersonates the real Puter cloud
API so you can develop, test, or demo your front-end without touching production
(or your wallet).

---

## Features

- **Instant endpoints** – spin up in <2 s
- **Stateful mocks** – files, users, apps persist in memory (or on disk)
- **Realistic latency** – optional random delays to feel “cloudy”
- **No API keys required** – just `deno task start` and go
